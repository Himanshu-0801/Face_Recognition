## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Face_Recognition.git
cd Face_Recognition

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üèóÔ∏è Usage

1. **Create a dataset** for a new user:

```bash
python dataset_creater.py
```

2. **Train the recognizer**:

```bash
python trainer.py
```

3. **Detect & recognize faces** in real-time:

```bash
python detect.py
```

> Make sure your webcam is connected for real-time detection.

## üìä Accuracy & Improvements

* **Current model:** Haar Cascade + LBPH
* **Accuracy depends on:** dataset size, lighting conditions, and image quality.
* **How to improve:**

  * Use **DNN-based models** (OpenCV DNN with ResNet, Caffe, or TensorFlow).
  * Use **FaceNet, DeepFace, or dlib embeddings** for more robust recognition.
  * Collect **diverse datasets per person** (different angles, lighting, expressions).
  * Evaluate recognition accuracy using **precision, recall, F1-score**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* LBPH performs well for controlled environments but struggles in **low-light** or **crowded scenes**.
* Haar Cascade detection can produce **false positives** for non-face objects.
